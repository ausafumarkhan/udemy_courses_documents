								GIT Notes

If you are getting server certificate issue, on the local machine or container, execute the following command 

		$ git config --global http.sslVerify false

For configuring a Git username and email, use the following commands:
	$ git config --global user.name "abcdefgh"

	$ git config --global user.email "xyz@gmail.com"


DETACHED HEAD
	$ git checkout <commit-hash>

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

 	$ git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

 	$ git switch -
