Installing Jenkins on CentOS 8 involves several steps, including setting up the necessary repositories, installing Jenkins, and starting the service. 
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

Step 1: Update the System
First, ensure your system is up to date by running:

sudo yum update -y

Note: if you are unable to update the system due to mirror error, execute the following commands

cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo sed -i 's/mirrorlist/#mirrorlist/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
sudo sed -i 's|#baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org|baseurl=http://vault.centos.org|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
sudo yum update -y


Step 2: Install Java
Jenkins requires Java to run. Install OpenJDK 17 (or any other supported version):

sudo yum install java-17-openjdk-devel -y

Step 3: Enable the Jenkins Repository
Add the Jenkins repository to your system:

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key

Note: If you are getting error for gcpkey, then disable it in the repo
sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo
Add or modify the following line:

gpgcheck=0
Save and exit the file, then try installing Jenkins again:



Step 4: Install Jenkins
Now, install Jenkins using the following command:

sudo yum install jenkins -y

Step 5: Start and Enable Jenkins
Start the Jenkins service and enable it to start on boot:

sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins

Step 6: Adjust the Firewall
If you have a firewall enabled, you need to allow traffic on port 8080 (the default Jenkins port):

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Step 7: Access Jenkins
Open a web browser and navigate to
http://your_server_ip_or_domain:8080
. You should see the Jenkins setup screen.

Step 8: Unlock Jenkins
During the initial setup, Jenkins will ask for an administrator password. You can find this password in the following file:

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Copy the password and paste it into the Jenkins setup screen.

Step 9: Customize Jenkins
Follow the on-screen instructions to install suggested plugins and create your first admin user.

Step 10: Complete the Setup
Once the setup is complete, you can start using Jenkins.

Additional Tips
Backup: Regularly back up your Jenkins configuration and jobs.
Security: Secure your Jenkins instance by configuring proper authentication and authorization.
Updates: Keep Jenkins and its plugins up to date to benefit from the latest features and security patches.
By following these steps, you should have a working Jenkins installation on CentOS 8.
